# Pneumonia-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file, **PneumoniaDetector.ipynb**, that provides an end-to-end implementation of a machine learning pipeline for detecting pneumonia from medical imaging data. The notebook is particularly useful for healthcare professionals, researchers, and data scientists looking to automate and enhance diagnostic accuracy using artificial intelligence.

---

## Key Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Handles medical imaging data, such as chest X-rays, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **Model Training**: Implements a deep learning model using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for binary classification (Pneumonia vs. Healthy).
- **Evaluation**: Includes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualization of training performance and predictions, including heatmaps for model interpretability.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Note: Add a `requirements.txt` file listing the dependencies, if not already included.)

---

## Dataset
The notebook is designed to work with chest X-ray datasets, such as:

- [ChestX-ray8 Dataset](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC)
- [Kaggle's Pneumonia Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

Ensure the dataset is downloaded and organized into a structured format:
```
/data
    /train
        /Pneumonia
        /Healthy
    /test
        /Pneumonia
        /Healthy
```

Update the file paths in the notebook to point to your dataset location.
